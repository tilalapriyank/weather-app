- **API:** OpenWeatherMap (or any other weather API)
- **Hosting:** Railway (or any cloud platform)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the app locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if backend is used)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd weather-app
    ```

3. If using a backend, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser or run a local server (e.g., using `Live Server` in VSCode or similar tools).
